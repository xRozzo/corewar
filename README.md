## Introduction

Corewar is a programming game where participants create `virtual` warriors
(programs) that battle for `control` of a virtual computer memory space. The
goal is to write a program that can survive and eliminate opponents by
strategically manipulating the `memory` of the virtual machine.

## How to Compile

To compile the Corewar project, simply run the following command:

```sh
make
```

This will build the necessary components and generate the executable.
